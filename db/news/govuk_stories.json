It is approximately 65 cm wide, 125 cm long and 129 cm high (measured at the seat back, 85 cm with the seat back folded down). Its total weight is approximately 107 kg (108 kg including the batteries). The maximum load is approximately 130 kg.\n\nThe vehicle has the following characteristics:\n\n*   a horizontal platform connecting the front and rear sections; the platform cannot be adjusted in any way (e.g. folded or tilted) to suit the user’s needs\n*   two sprung axles, rear-axle drive and an 820mm wheelbase\n*   gradient capability 130\n*   turning circle 210 cm\n*   two sets of inflatable tyres (the rear tyres being larger than the front ones)\n*   a configurable, height-adjustable rotating seat with supports and armrests and a non-slip surface for the feet\n*   an adjustable fold-down steering column with oval-shaped handlebars\n*   front and rear lights, direction indicators and rear-view mirrors\n\nThe steering column also has a dashboard featuring a switch box, a speed control, a horn button, an engine-idle button, a blinker switch, a light switch, a battery-status indicator and a speed adjuster.\n\nThe vehicle has two manually operated levers for accelerating, braking and reversing. The steering can be adjusted to allow operation with one hand.\n\nIt has a ‘smart’ regenerative electromagnetic braking system.\n\nWith fully charged batteries, the vehicle has a maximum range of up to 45 kilometres and can reach a maximum speed of approximately 15-16 km\/h.\n\nIt may be fitted with small anti-tipping wheels at the back, a shopping basket, a walking-stick holder, etc.\n\nThe vehicle may be stowed for transport purposes. It may be used on roads, pavements, footpaths, pathways in parks, cycle paths and certain leisure trails, or in pedestrian areas (e.g. shopping precincts).\n\n### Classification (Combined Nomenclature (CN) code)\n\n8703 10 18\n\n## Reason\n\nClassification is determined by General Rules 1 and 6 for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature and by the wording of CN codes 8703 , 8703 10 and 8703 10 18.\n\nClassification under heading 8713 as a carriage for disabled persons is excluded as the vehicle is not specially designed for the transport of disabled persons: it has no special features to alleviate a disability.\n\nAlthough the vehicle is designed so that the steering can be controlled with one hand and features a comfortable rotating seat with supports and a non-slip surface for the feet (and may optionally be fitted with small anti-tipping wheels), such characteristics do not objectively constitute special features designed to alleviate a disability (see also the Combined Nomenclature Explanatory Notes (CNEN) to subheading 8713 90 00 , the Harmonized System Explanatory Notes to heading 8713 and HS classification opinion 8703.10\/1).\n\nIn addition, vehicles fitted with a separate, adjustable steering column and those reaching a maximum speed over 10 km per hour are excluded from heading 8713 (see also CNEN to subheading 8713 90 00 ).\n\nThe vehicle is used for transporting persons and upon presentation to customs authorities it is not recognisable as a vehicle designed solely for disabled persons (see Case C-198\/15 (1)), based on its objective characteristics and properties which must be assessed at the time of customs clearance (see Case C-286\/15 (2)). Any subsequent post-clearance modification of the vehicle is disregarded as is any assessment of the vehicle that may be carried out by a national authority for purposes other than those laid down in customs legislation.\n\nThe vehicle is a special type of vehicle for the transport of persons.\n\nIt is therefore to be classified under CN code 8703 10 18 as a motor vehicle principally designed for the transport of persons, similar to golf cars.",

In those language versions, the products now referred to in subheading 2403 99 10 are referred to as ‘Kautabak und Schnupftabak’ in German, as ‘tabac à mâcher et tabac à priser’ in French, as ‘tabacco da masticare e tabacco da fiuto’ in Italian and ‘pruimtabak en snuif’ in Dutch.\n\n(4) In the English version of the Common Customs Tariff, which dates from 1973 and thus postdates the German, French, Italian and Dutch language versions, the products now referred to in subheading 2403 99 10 are referred to as ‘chewing tobacco and snuff’.\n\n(5) In English, the word ‘snuff’, when used about tobacco products, means a preparation of pulverized tobacco to be inhaled through the nostrils, chewed, or placed against the gums. The English language version of the CN and some other language versions have thus led to confusion as to whether the term ‘snuff’ should be restricted to products that can be inhaled through the nose or also include preparations of pulverized tobacco that can be placed against the gums.\n\n(6) All different language versions of Union acts are authentic, but later language versions cannot expand or restrict the scope of Union Acts that predate those later language versions.\n\n(7) It is clear from the German, French, Italian and Dutch language versions that the intention of the legislator was to restrict the products referred to in subheading 2403 99 10 of the CN to chewing tobacco and tobacco products that can be inhaled through the nose. In order to ensure a uniform interpretation of the CN throughout the Union and thus to ensure legal certainty, the wording of subheading 2403 99 10 should therefore be amended to clarify that the meaning of the terms ‘snuff’ should be restricted to nasal tobacco.\n\n(8) Regulation (EEC) No 2658\/87 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,\n\nHas adopted this regulation:\n\nArticle 1 The row for CN code 2403 99 10 of Chapter 24 of Part Two of the Combined Nomenclature set out in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658\/87 is replaced by the following:\n\n‘2403 99 10 Chewing tobacco and snuff (nasal tobacco) 41,6\n\nArticle 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2021.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 25 May 2020.",

Chapter 94 only covers parts of the goods of headings 9401 and 9403, when identifiable by their shape or other specific features as parts designed solely or principally for an article of those headings (see also the Harmonized System Explanatory Notes (HSEN) to Chapter 94, Parts).\n\nSecondly, the slats do not constitute parts of beds, armchairs or sofas, but as they are designed to be assembled into their frames, they constitute parts of a mattress support of heading 9404. According to Note 3 (B) to Chapter 94, mattress supports, presented separately, are not to be classified in, inter alia, heading 9401 or 9403 as parts of goods. As heading 9404 does not cover “parts”, but only complete products, classification under that heading is also excluded.\n\nThe slats are according to their objective characteristics (paired dimensions, rounded edges, surface treatment, high load-bearing capacity and bending strength) recognisable as parts of frames. They have been worked in such a way that they have been given the essential character of articles of another heading (articles of laminated wood) (see also the HSEN to heading 4412, second paragraph). Classification under heading 4412 as laminated wood is therefore excluded.\n\nThe slats are therefore to be classified according to their constituent material under CN code 4421 99 99 as other articles of wood.",

The regulation was published on 7 April 2020.\n\nThis is not considered a change in UK practice.\n\nL116\/1\n\nReg. 2020\/523\n\n## Reason\n\nThe European commission, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658\/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff (1), and in particular Article 9(1)(e) thereof, Whereas:\n\n(1) Regulation (EEC) No 2658\/87 establishes a goods nomenclature (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Combined Nomenclature’), which is reproduced in Annex I to that Regulation.\n\n(2) In the interest of legal certainty, it is necessary to clarify the classification of orthopaedic appliances of subheading 9021 10 10 of the Combined Nomenclature.\n\n(3) In accordance with the judgment of the Court of Justice in Joined Cases C-260\/00 to C-263\/00 (2), the Harmonized System Explanatory Notes to heading 9021 and Note 6 to Chapter 90, orthopaedic appliances are defined as products specially designed for a particular orthopaedic purpose.\n\n(4) In that judgment, the Court of Justice explained that orthopaedic appliances have a specific medical purpose in distinction to ordinary (simple) products that are for general use. The criteria for distinguishing orthopaedic appliances from ordinary products also include the method of manufacture, the materials of which they are made, their method of operation, their adjustability to the patient’s specific handicaps.\n\n(5) Note 6 to Chapter 90 provides that orthopaedic appliances serve either to prevent or correct bodily deformities or to support or hold parts of the body following an illness, operation or injury.\n\n(6) Section (I) of the Harmonized System Explanatory Notes to heading 9021 provides examples of a number of orthopaedic appliances covered by the heading together with examples of products that are not covered by heading 9021. The product scope established by these explanatory notes is in line with the new Additional note.\n\n(7) For reasons of legal certainty, it is necessary to provide examples of medical purposes that certain products might serve which distinguish them from orthopaedic appliances that are designed for a particular orthopaedic purpose.\n\n(8) For reasons of legal certainty, explanations should be provided on the method of operation (high degree of precision) of orthopaedic appliances that are meant to prevent further injuries or bodily deformities in distinction to ordinary products that are not considered to be designed with the same high degree of precision and, thus, are not able to prevent completely undesired movements.\n\n(9) A new Additional note should therefore be added to Chapter 90 of Part Two of the Combined Nomenclature to ensure its uniform interpretation.\n\n(10) The new Additional note is in line with Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018\/787 (3) classifiying an ankle bandage (so-called ‘lace-orthosis’), with the existing Explanatory Notes to the Combined Nomenclature to subheading 9021 10 10, and reflects the established classification practice of the Member States.\n\n(11) Regulation (EEC) No 2658\/87 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,\n\nHas adopted this regulation:\n\nArticle 1 Chapter 90 of Part Two of Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658\/87 is amended as follows:\n\n(1) the heading ‘Additional note’ after note 7 is replaced by the heading ‘Additional notes’:\n\n(2) the following Additional note is added:\n\n‘2. For the purposes of subheading 9021 10 10, the expression ‘orthopaedic appliances’ means appliances which are specially designed for a particular orthopaedic purpose, in distinction to products that might be used for various purposes (for example, products for overstrained joints, ligaments or tendons caused by sporting activities, type writing, and products which simply alleviate pain in the defective or disabled part of the body, for example, caused by inflammation).\n\nThe ‘orthopaedic appliances’ must completely prevent a specific movement of the defective or disabled part of the body (for example, joints, ligaments, tendons) in order to exclude further injuries or bodily deformities or an aggravation of such injuries or deformities, as distinct from other products that cannot prevent specific movements, yet prevent reflex movements (movements carried out subconsciously) through the relative inflexibility of those products due to, for example, flexible splints, pressure pads, non-elastic textile material, restrictions through ‘Velcro-type’ straps.’.\n\nArticle 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 7 April 2020.",

The inlay of thin plastics loses its form and cracks and\/or breaks after the cosmetic products are taken out and put back several times.\n\nThe article is to be used for packing, transport and sale of cosmetic products, and also has a decorative value, within the meaning of the HSEN to heading 4819, (A), first paragraph. The inlay holds the cosmetic products in place during transport and the transparent window on the lid of the container displays the cosmetic products for sales purposes.\n\nIt is the packing container of paperboard that gives the article its essential character and not the inlay of plastics which serves merely to hold the cosmetic products in place.\n\nThe article is therefore to be classified under CN code 4819 50 00 as other packing containers.",

Therefore, upon presentation to customs, the objective characteristics of the article are not those of fuel elements (cartridges) for nuclear reactors of heading 8401. Consequently, classification as fuel elements (cartridges), non-irradiated, for nuclear reactors, of heading 8401 is excluded.\n\nThe article is therefore to be classified under CN code 8109 90 00 as other articles of zirconium.",

It is imported on its own (without roof, other walls and without a supporting structure).\n\n### Classification (Combined Nomenclature (CN) code)\n\n6307 90 98\n\n## Reason\n\nClassification is determined by general rules 1 and 6 for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature (GIR), note 7(f) to Section XI and by the wording of CN codes 6307, 6307 90 and 6307 90 98.\n\nClassification of the article as a tarpaulin under CN code 6306 12 00 is excluded, because tarpaulins are generally made of a heavy fabric and are used to protect goods against bad weather (see also the Harmonized System Explanatory Note (HSEN) to heading 6306 (1)).\n\nThe zippers sewn to the article and the lightweight material indicate that the article is not suitable\/intended to be used as a tarpaulin of CN code 6306 12 00.\n\nFurthermore, the article cannot be classified as a tent under CN code 6306 22 00 because due to its objective characteristics, the article does not have the essential character of a complete article (tent) within the meaning of GIR 2(a). It is not evident either from its objective characteristics whether the article is to be used as part of a tent, a gazebo or another product.\n\nHeading 6307 applies to other made-up articles of any textile fabric, provided they are not included in other headings of Section XI. It also covers made-up flat protective sheets other than tarpaulins and ground sheets of heading 6306 (see also the HSEN to heading 6307, first paragraph and second paragraph, (8)).\n\nThe article is therefore to be classified under CN code 6307 90 98 as other made-up article.",

Each chamber contains an air filled bag of plastics covered with a thin layer of silicone.\n\nThe cushion is adjustable according to the degree to which the 2 chambers are inflated, which causes the position of the bag of plastics in each chamber to shift when the user is sitting on the cushion.\n\nThe cushion has a removable anti-slip cover of textile materials that has 2 ‘velcro’-type straps attached to its underside.\n\nThe article is intended to prevent the user developing pressure sores. It provides a relieving effect on the seat bones and improves the comfort of the user.\n\nImages:\n\n![](https:\/\/assets.publishing.service.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/image_data\/file\/79844\/Wheelchair_cushion.jpg)\n\nImage showing wheelchair cushion\n\n![](https:\/\/assets.publishing.service.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/image_data\/file\/79843\/Wheelchair_cushion_inside_anti-slip_cover.jpg)\n\nImage showing wheelchair cushion inside anti-slip cover\n\n### Classification (Combined Nomenclature (CN) code)\n\nCode 3926 90 97.\n\n### Reason\n\nClassification is determined by general rules 1, 3(b) and 6 for the interpretation of the CN and by the wording of CN codes 3926 , 3926 90 and 3926 90 97.\n\nClassification of the article under heading 9404 (articles of bedding and similar furnishing) is excluded because pneumatic cushions are excluded from this heading within the meaning of note 1 (a) to Chapter 94 and, consequently, pneumatic cushions of plastics are classified under heading 3926 (see also the Harmonized System Explanatory Notes to heading 9404, last paragraph, (b)).\n\nClassification under CN code 8714 20 00 as parts and accessories of carriages for disabled persons is also excluded, because the article is not identifiable as being suitable for use solely or principally with carriages for disabled persons within the meaning of note 3 to Section XVII. Considering its objective characteristics, the article can be used on many seats and chairs as well as on seats of wheelchairs.\n\nFor example, the article is not designed for use with a specific seat, because it has no specific means by which it can be attached that would identify it for use with a specific seat. The anti-slip cover and the ‘velcro’-type straps can be attached to many different types of seats. There is therefore nothing to identify the article as being designed for use with a specific type of seat (see also the HSEN to heading 8714, first paragraph, (i)).\n\nMoreover, classification under CN code 8714 20 00 as parts and accessories of carriages for disabled persons is excluded because the article is neither indispensable for the functioning of the wheelchair, nor does it adapt the wheelchair for a particular operation or increase its range of operations or enable it to perform a particular service connected with its main function which is enabling a handicapped person to move (see judgment of the Court of 16 June 2011, Unomedical, C-152\/10, ECLI:EU:C:2011:402, paragraphs 29, 30 and 36). A wheelchair operates in the same way as it does without the cushion. The cushion merely makes the wheelchair more comfortable and endurable for the user.\n\nAlthough the article consists of different components (the cushion of plastics and the cover of textile materials), the article is to be classified as if it consisted of the cushion of plastics because the cushion gives the article its essential character within the meaning of general rule 3 (b). The textile component is merely a cover that protects and keeps the essential component in place. The article is therefore to be classified according to its constituent material under CN code 3926 90 97 as ‘other articles of plastics’.",

		"precis" : "Check the new tariff classification of an article (so-called ‘lace-orthosis’) made of several pieces of textile material sewn together, with an opening for the heel and toes.",
		"story" : "A new regulation [2018\/787](https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/legal-content\/EN\/TXT\/?uri=CELEX%3A32018R0787) has been published on 31 May 2018 in L134\/1.\n\nIt’s important to recognise that this notice is not considered a change to UK practice.\n\n## New regulation\n\n### Description of goods\n\nAn article (so-called ‘lace-orthosis’) made of several pieces of textile material sewn together, with an opening for the heel and the toes, hemmed around the openings and on the edges of the article. The vamp area is closed by a tongue made of crocheted textile material. The other textile parts consist of several layers of elastically crocheted textile materials.\n\nA plate of elastic plastic is fixed to the textile and only partly visible on the outside of the article. The plastic plate reaches around the sole and has eyelets along the vamp of the article and lace hooks along the shaft to allow for tightening the article around the foot and calf with textile laces.\n\nThe plastic plate gives some stability to the article. Nevertheless it is flexible and, when tightened with the laces, it applies pressure against the foot and calf.\n\nThis article is presented to be worn inside a shoe and used as an ankle bandage in the case of sprained ankles and contusions of the ankle, ligament tears and lesions, and for the prevention of these injuries, as well as in the case of ligament instability. However, it cannot completely prevent a specific movement of the defective part of the body.\n\nIn post-operative rehabilitation, it facilitates a return to full weight-bearing.\n\n### Classification (Combined Nomenclature (CN) code)\n\nCode 6307 90 10.\n\n### Reason\n\nClassification is determined by general rules 1, 3(c) and 6 for the interpretation of the CN and by the wording of CN codes 6307, 6307 90 and 6307 90 10.\n\nThe article cannot be adjusted to a specific handicap of a patient but has a multi-functional use. It is similar to a simple textile bandage that is wrapped around a ligament and tightened around certain parts to apply pressure to support healing or to prevent further injuries, ensuring that undesired movements are not carried out subconsciously as reflex movements (see also the Explanatory Notes to the Combined Nomenclature of the European Union (CNEN) to subheading 9021 10 10, second paragraph).\n\nConsequently, the article’s objective characteristics are such that they do not distinguish it from ordinary supports for general use, in particular, by reason of the materials of which it is made (flexible materials), the method of operation (applying pressure through tightening) or the adjustability to the patient’s specific handicaps (see also Note 6 to Chapter 90 and judgment of 7 November 2002, Lohmann and Medi Bayreuth, Joined Cases C-260\/00 to C-263\/00, ECLI:EU:C:2002:637, paragraphs 39 and 45).\n\nMoreover, the article cannot be classified as an ‘orthopaedic appliance’ under CN code 9021 10 10 as, due to its elasticity, it cannot completely prevent a specific movement of the defective part of the body in order to exclude further injuries (see also the CNEN to subheading 9021 10 10, second paragraph). For example, in case of torn ligaments, the article should make the tilting of the ankle joint impossible even when running or jumping. However, the textile material and the flexible plastic material that the article is made of cannot sustain the weight of the body during running.\n\nThe desired effect of application of pressure is given by the plastic as well as by the textile materials. Consequently, both materials are equally essential within the meaning of general rule 3(b) for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature and the article is to be classified under the heading which occurs last in numerical order among those which equally merit consideration (headings 3926 and 6307).\n\nThe article is therefore to be classified under CN code 6307 90 10 as ‘other made-up textile articles’.",

It consists of a loosely crocheted textile fabric creating a net-like structure attached to an inflatable tube of plastics framing the textile fabric. An inflatable pillow of plastics is attached to one side of the tube. The tube and pillow are completely encased by a woven textile fabric of synthetic filament yarn.\n\nThe external surface of the article is completely of textile materials, which prevail over the plastics in volume. Especially the net-like structure where a user lies is exclusively of textile material. However, plastics prevail over the textile materials in weight and value.\n\nThe article is designed to float on water, similarly to a pneumatic water mattress.\n\n### Classification (Combined Nomenclature (CN) code)\n\n6306 90 00\n\n## Reason\n\nClassification is determined by general rules (GIR) 1, 3(b) and 6 for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature (CN), by note 7(f) to Section XI of the CN and by the wording of CN codes 6306 and 6306 90 00. The article is a composite good consisting of different materials (textile fabrics and plastics) within the meaning of GIR 3(b).\n\nClassification under CN code 3926 90 97 as other articles of plastics is excluded, because the article has the objective characteristics of a textile article when looked at, touched or lied on due to its external surface material of exclusively textile material. Although the plastics play an important role in relation to the use of the article as a floating device, the net-like textile fabrics in the middle are essential to allow a person to lie on the device while floating. Therefore, overall the textile materials (external surface material, crocheted net-like textile fabric) give the article its essential character within the meaning of GIR 3(b).\n\nGiven the objective characteristics of the article (designed to be taken along to different places and to be used there temporarily, lightweight, easy to transport and to set-up, similarity to pneumatic mattresses) it is an article for camping. See also the CN Explanatory Note to heading 6306 90 00 and the Harmonized System Explanatory Notes to 6306, first paragraph, point (5).\n\nThe article is therefore to be classified under CN code 6306 90 00 as camping goods.",

They are blunt at their ends (i.e. without pointed tips) and they are individually marked by colour. The colour marking indicates the alloying element and tungsten content. The rods are packed in batches.\n\nThe rods are designed to be sharpened and used as welding electrodes for TIG (Tungsten Inert Gas) welding. The purpose of the electrode during this welding process is to form the arc between the electrode and the workpiece. The electrode does not melt during the process; i.e. it is non-consumable.\n\n### Classification (Combined Nomenclature (CN) code)\n\n8101 99 10\n\n## Reason\n\nClassification is determined by general rules 1 and 6 for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature, note 3 and note 5 (a) to Section XV, note 1 (d) to Chapter 74, subheading note 1 to Chapter 81 and by the wording of CN codes 8101, 8101 99 and 8101 99 10.\n\nThe rods need to undergo a special tip grinding process in order to obtain the shape of the tip required to become electrodes properly usable for TIG welding. Therefore, upon presentation to customs, the objective characteristics of the article are not those of welding electrodes for welding machines of heading 8515.\n\nConsequently, classification as parts of machines or apparatus for arc welding of metals of heading 8515 is excluded.\n\nGiven its objective characteristics and properties, the article corresponds to the wording of heading 8101, which includes tungsten (wolfram) and articles thereof. (See also the first paragraph of the Harmonized System Explanatory Notes (HSEN) to heading 8101, which indicates that tungsten (wolfram) in the form of rolled or drawn bars falls in this heading.\n\nThat provision is also in line with the first paragraph of the HSEN to heading 8311, according to which electrodes of base metal not coated or cored with flux material are excluded from heading 8311 and are to be classified in the appropriate Chapters according to their constituent material.)\n\nThe article is therefore to be classified under CN code 8101 99 10 as bars and rods, other than those obtained simply by sintering, of tungsten.",

Classification under heading 8542 was excluded as the product contained both a monolithic integrated circuit and a quartz crystal.\n\n(3) By Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016\/1821 (4), the definition of electronic integrated circuits laid down for the purposes of headings 8541 and 8542 in Note 9(b) to Chapter 85 of the Combined Nomenclature was expanded to include multi-component integrated circuits as defined in point (4) of Note 9(b) to Chapter 85, with effect from 1 January 2017. As a result, goods within the scope of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 863\/2013 are to be classified under heading 8542 as an electronic integrated circuit.\n\n(4) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 863\/2013 should therefore be repealed in order to avoid potential divergences in tariff classification of such goods and to ensure the uniform application of the Combined Nomenclature within the Union.\n\n(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,\n\nHas adopted this regulation:\n\nArticle 1 Implementing Regulation (EU) No 863\/2013 is repealed.\n\nArticle 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 8 April 2020.",

		"story" : "## New Regulation\n\nA new [regulation](https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/legal-content\/EN\/TXT\/?qid=1586949715733&uri=CELEX:32020R0517) was published on 3 April 2020.\n\nThis is not considered to be a change in UK practice.\n\nL114\/4\n\nReg. 2020\/517\n\nAn article consisting of a garland of artificial fir (pine tree), with a length of approximately 5 metre, and a LED light chain of approximately 60 lights, which is wrapped around the garland. The light chain is powered by a 230 V power supply. Both the garland and the light chain are made of plastics.\n\n### Classification (Combined Nomenclature (CN) code)\n\n6702 10 00\n\n## Reason\n\nClassification is determined by general rules (GIR) 1, 3(b) and 6 for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature and by the wording of CN codes 6702 and 6702 10 00.\n\nThe article is a composite product within the meaning of GIR 3(b). Due to its objective characteristics, namely the fact that it consists of a garland of artificial fir with lights that give an additional decorative effect, the article is primarily designed to have a decorative function.\n\nIn addition, the garland of artificial fir would continue to be displayed for ornamental or decorative purposes even when the lights are powered off. Therefore, the garland of artificial fir, which resembles the natural product (see also the Harmonised System Explanatory Notes to heading 6702), is the component that gives the article its essential character as a decorative article. Classification of the article under subheading 9405 40 as other electric lamps and lighting fittings is therefore excluded.\n\nClassification of the article under subheading 9505 10 as an article for Christmas festivities is also excluded, because its objective characteristics suggest that it is not exclusively used for Christmas festivities but mainly as decoration during the winter season (see additional note 1 to Chapter 95, 1(a) last paragraph).\n\nThe article is therefore to be classified under CN code 6702 10 00 as artificial foliage, of plastics.",

Although the goods consist of textile fabrics of heading 5903 (textile fabrics, impregnated, coated, covered or laminated with plastics), classification in Chapter 59 is excluded in accordance with Note 8(a) to Section XI, because Chapter 59 does not apply to made-up goods within the meaning of Note 7 to the same Section.\n\nHeading 6307 applies to other made-up articles of any textile fabric within the meaning of Note 1 to Chapter 63, provided they are not included in other headings of Section XI. It also covers articles in the length that can be adapted by cutting them to the desired length and that are made-up within the meaning of Note 7 to Section XI (see also the Harmonized System Explanatory Notes to heading 6307, first and third paragraph).\n\nConsequently, the goods are to be classified under CN code 6307 90 10 as other made-up textile articles.",

Specific types can be vulcanised with a soap\/sulphur system in which the sulphur has the function of an accelerator and not of a vulcanising agent. In either system, the result of the vulcanisation is a C-O-C linkage.\n\nTherefore, the goods do not fall within the definition of synthetic rubbers contained in Note 4(a) to Chapter 40 since they cannot be vulcanised with sulphur.\n\nConsequently, the goods cannot be classified in Chapter 40.\n\nTherefore, the goods are to be classified in CN code 3906 90 90 as other acrylic polymers in primary form.",

The CN code for that category of products changed owing to changes to the codes in the Harmonised System (HS) and the CN, and regulation (EC) No 1218\/1999 was amended by implementing Regulation (EU) No 441\/2013 (3) to indicate the new CN code 6306 90 00. By implementing Regulation (EU) No 670\/2013 (4), the Commission classified an article which has the essential character of an outdoor canopy but is presented without frame, poles or accessories under CN code 6306 90 00 as ‘other camping goods’, because it has no sides or walls, which permit the formation of an enclosure.\n\n(2) During its 62nd session in September 2018, the Harmonized System Committee (HSC) of the World Customs Organisation (WCO) approved classification opinion 6306.22\/1 classifying a product called temporary gazebo, measuring approximately 3m × 3m × 2.50m and consisting of a steel tube frame with connecting pieces and plastic feet, and a roof covering with cladding for the four corner posts. The gazebo is open on all four sides and is not anchored firmly to the ground. It was classified in HS subheading 6306 22, which corresponds to CN code 6306 22 00.\n\n(3) Given the identical or very similar characteristics of the product with the articles described in Regulation (EC) No 1218\/1999 and implementing Regulation (EU) No 670\/2013, the tariff classification of the articles as set out in the annex to those regulations is not in accordance with WCO HSC classification opinion 6306.22\/1.\n\n(4) The Union is, by virtue of Council Decision 87\/369\/EEC (5), a contracting party of the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (known as the ‘Harmonized System’ or ‘HS’), drawn up by the Customs Cooperation Council (known as the WCO). Classification opinions issued by the HSC are in principle guidance instruments for Union tariff measures.\n\n(5) With a view to securing uniformity in the interpretation and application of the HS at international level and considering that the decision of the HSC is in conformity with the wording of HS subheading 6306.22, the Union should apply WCO HSC classification opinion 6306.22\/1.\n\n(6) The legal basis and the adoption procedure for amending Regulation (EC) No 1218\/1999 and for repealing implementing Regulation (EU) No 670\/2013 are the same. Therefore, it is appropriate to adopt a single act for those purposes.\n\n(7) Regulation (EC) No 1218\/1999 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n(8) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 670\/2013 should therefore be repealed.\n\n(9) The measures provided for in this regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee, has adopted this regulation.\n\n### Article 1\n\nIn the annex to Regulation (EC) No 1218\/1999, the row corresponding to point 6 of the table is deleted.\n\n### Article 2\n\nImplementing Regulation (EU) No 670\/2013 is repealed.\n\n### Article 3\n\nThis regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\nThis regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all member states.\n\nDone at Brussels, 6 September 2019.\n\nFor the Commission, on behalf of the President, Stephen Quest, Director-General, Directorate-General for Taxation and Customs Union.",

(11,17 litres of alcohol) are mixed with 37,95 litres of distilled ethyl alcohol at 28,28% vol. (10,73 litres of alcohol). The fermented alcohol component in the product accounts for 51% and the distilled alcohol accounts for 49% of the total alcohol content.\n\nΤhe resulting mixture is diluted to a drinking strength of 4% to 6% vol. by adding carbonated water. Sugar, citric acid, a preservative agent (E 202), caffeine, colouring agents (E 102, E 124) and flavourings (for instance mango, rum, passion fruit or port) are added as well.\n\nThe product is presented to be used for the production of cocktails. The smell and taste are alcoholic, acidic and sweet.\n\nThe product is for human consumption and is put up for retail sale in containers holding 2 litres or less.\n\n### Classification (Combined Nomenclature (CN) code)\n\n2208 90 69\n\n### Reason\n\nClassification is determined by general rules 1 and 6 for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature and the wording of CN codes 2208 , 2208 90 and 2208 90 69.\n\nThe product is an alcoholic beverage that has not retained the character of a product falling under heading 2206 (see also the Harmonized System Explanatory Notes to heading 2206 , third paragraph) as the added substances have led to a loss of the properties and characteristics of a fermented apple juice.\n\nThe fact that the distilled alcohol does not exceed, either in volume or percentage, 49% of the alcohol present in the product, with the remaining 51% resulting from a process of fermentation, is not a classification criterion as there is no majority rule by percentages that determines the character of products of heading 2206.\n\nConsequently, classification under heading 2206 is excluded as the product shows objective characteristics similar to those of a spirituous beverage and not anymore those obtained by fermentation of a specific fruit or plant.\n\nThe product is therefore to be classified under CN code 2208 90 69 as other spirituous beverage in containers holding 2 litres or less.\n\n## New regulation for a product consisting of an alcoholic liquid with an alcoholic strength by volume of 15%\n\nA product consisting of an alcoholic liquid with an alcoholic strength by volume of 15%.\n\nIt is produced by fermenting a sugar beet extract, consisting by weight of 93,4% sucrose (96,7% sucrose in dry matter), protein, trace minerals, fibre and water.\n\nThe fermentation process is achieved by the addition of water and yeast, and it proceeds until an alcohol content of 15% has been reached. The yeast is then removed by sedimentation and microfiltration. The product has no specific smell and taste except that of alcohol.\n\nThe product is intended to be used as a base in the formulation of alcoholic beverages.\n\nIt is presented in bulk.\n\n### Classification (Combined Nomenclature (CN) code)\n\n2208 90 99\n\n### Reason\n\nClassification is determined by general rules 1 and 6 for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature and the wording of CN codes 2208 , 2208 90 and 2208 90 99.\n\nSugar beet extract is neutral raw sugar and therefore the product cannot have the taste, smell and\/or appearance of a beverage produced from a particular fruit or natural product. Consequently, it has not obtained the characteristics of a product falling under heading 2206 but acquired those of ethyl alcohol of heading 2208.\n\nThe product, which is obtained through processing a fermented sugar beet extract and is intended to be used as a base in the formulation of alcoholic beverages, being neutral in terms of colour, smell and taste as a result of purification (including microfiltration), falls therefore under heading 2208.\n\nThe product is therefore to be classified under CN code 2208 90 99 as other undenaturated ethyl alcohol in containers holding more than 2 litres.",

The production process comprises refining, hydrolysis, ethyl esterification and fractionation. During hydrolysis and ethyl esterification, the triglycerides are transformed into fatty acid ethyl esters.\n\nThe product is intended for further processing in the food, feed, and pharmaceutical industry.

The degree of processing that the product has undergone therefore exceeds what is permitted under heading 1516 as only re-esterified triglycerides are covered by that heading (see also the Harmonized System Explanatory Notes (HSEN) to heading 1516, part (B), point (2).\n\nMoreover, fatty acid ethyl esters are not animal or vegetable fats and oils (see also the HSEN to Chapter 15, General, part (A), second paragraph).\n\nClassification of the product in Chapter 38 is excluded, as the product has nutritive value and is used in the preparation of human foodstuffs (see note 1(b) to Chapter 38).\n\nThe product is therefore to be classified under CN code 2106 90 92 as other food preparation (see also the HS classification opinion 2106.90\/37).",

Such a daily dose includes 40 milligram (mg) of vitamin C, 1mg of vitamin B6, 200μg of folic acid and 2μg of vitamin B12. The product is presented in a 60 millilitre plastic bottle, with a dripping device, for retail sale.\n\n### Classification (Combined Nomenclature (CN) code)\n\nCode 2106 90 98.\n\n### Reason\n\nClassification is determined by general rules 1 and 6 for the interpretation of the CN and by the wording of CN codes 2106, 2106 90 and 2106 90 98.\n\nClassification in Chapter 30 as a medicament is excluded as specific diseases, ailments or their symptoms for which the product is to be used are not indicated. Therefore, the product does not fulfil the requirements of Additional note 1 to Chapter 30, first paragraph, point (a).\n\nClassification as a beverage under Chapter 22 is excluded as the product is not directly drinkable (see also the Explanatory Notes to the CN to Chapter 22, General, second paragraph, second sentence).\n\nThe product contains a sweetener, different vitamins and a high quantity of glycerin. Therefore, it has a more complex composition than a simple sugar syrup covered by subheadings 2106 90 30 to 2106 90 59 (see also the Harmonised System Explanatory Notes to heading 2106, point (12)).\n\nIts intended particular use is also indicated by its packaging and labelling as food supplement for retail sale. It is clear from the objective characteristics and properties of the product, in particular its composition, as well as the form of its presentation, that the product is intended for a specific use to support the immune system rather than for a more general use, which is the case for sugar syrups.\n\nThe product is therefore to be classified under CN code 2106 90 98 as other food preparation.",

In order to ensure uniform application of the Combined Nomenclature annexed to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658\/87 [(2)](https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/legal-content\/EN\/TXT\/HTML\/?uri=CELEX:32019R0368&qid=1551953993771&from=EN#ntr2-L_2019066EN.01000101-E0002), it is necessary to adopt measures concerning the classification of certain goods.\n    \n2.  By Implementing Regulation (EU) No 444\/2013 [(3)](https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/legal-content\/EN\/TXT\/HTML\/?uri=CELEX:32019R0368&qid=1551953993771&from=EN#ntr3-L_2019066EN.01000101-E0003), the Commission classified a product obtained from defatted soya beans after the extraction of the oil, further extracted with water and ethanol to remove soluble carbohydrates and minerals (‘product concerned’) under subheading 2309 90 31 of the Combined Nomenclature as ‘other preparations of a kind used in animal feeding’.\n    \n3.  As regards starch in products of heading 2309, it has to be ascertained whether any starch is present by applying a qualitative test (iodine-starch reaction; microscopic analysis). Once the presence of starch has been verified, the starch content of any product of heading 2309 is determined by using the polarimetric method (Ewers method) as laid down in Part L of Annex III of Commission Regulation (EC) No 152\/2009 [(4)](https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/legal-content\/EN\/TXT\/HTML\/?uri=CELEX:32019R0368&qid=1551953993771&from=EN#ntr4-L_2019066EN.01000101-E0004). Where the polarimetric method is not applicable, for example due to the presence in significant amounts of specific materials listed in Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 121\/2008 [(5)](https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/legal-content\/EN\/TXT\/HTML\/?uri=CELEX:32019R0368&qid=1551953993771&from=EN#ntr5-L_2019066EN.01000101-E0005), the enzymatic analytical method laid down in the Annex to that Regulation is to be applied.\n    \n4.  At the time of adoption of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 444\/2013, the only analytical method to be applied to the product concerned was the polarimetric method.\n    \n5.  By its judgment in case C-144\/15 (‘Customs Support Holland BV’) [(6)](https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/legal-content\/EN\/TXT\/HTML\/?uri=CELEX:32019R0368&qid=1551953993771&from=EN#ntr6-L_2019066EN.01000101-E0006), the Court ruled that a soya protein concentrate which has been made suitable for use as feed must be classified in heading 2309. The soya protein concentrate at issue in the main proceedings in that case is described as being obtained from dehulled, ground and steamed soya beans which first undergo an oil-extraction process, after which what remains is so-called soya meal. This meal is then treated with ethanol and water to extract the residual fat, reduce the content of components other than proteins, primarily carbohydrates or food fibre, and eliminate certain harmful substances. The soya protein concentrate obtained in this way does not contain any trace of the ethanol used and consists, inter alia, of proteins and starch.\n    \n6.  The product at issue in the main proceedings in case C-144\/15 and the product concerned are sufficiently similar as both are feed products based on soya products, which are to be classified in heading 2309. In both cases, the products are not a residue of heading 2304 directly resulting from the extraction of soya-bean oil but result from a process whereby the vegetable material from which the products have been derived has lost its essential characteristics.\n    \n7.  Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017\/68 [(7)](https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/legal-content\/EN\/TXT\/HTML\/?uri=CELEX:32019R0368&qid=1551953993771&from=EN#ntr7-L_2019066EN.01000101-E0007) added ‘soya products’ to the list of feed materials set out in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 121\/2008 in respect of which the starch content of preparations of a kind used in animal feeding (heading 2309) is to be determined using the enzymatic analytical method.\n    \n8.  Therefore, in the interest of legal certainty as regards the tariff classification of products of heading 2309 based on soya products and in order to ensure the uniform application of the Combined Nomenclature within the Union, Implementing Regulation (EU) No 444\/2013 should be repealed.",

It does not have the appearance of a basket of metal as the wire is completely covered by the paper and thus, not visible. Moreover, the article is mainly made of paper. Classification in heading 7323 is therefore excluded.\n\nAs the paper strips are twisted, they are considered paper yarn (textile yarn) within the meaning of heading 5308 (see also the Harmonised System Explanatory Notes (HSEN) to heading 5308, (B) paper yarn, third paragraph). Classification of the article in Chapter 46 is excluded by virtue of Note 1 to Chapter 46 because textile yarns are not considered ‘plaiting materials’.\n\nMoreover, the yarns are woven together creating a fabric (warp and weft strands). The basket is therefore not an article of paper yarn but an article made of fabric and its classification in heading 5609 is excluded (see also the HSEN to heading 5609, first and third paragraph, (c)).\n\nMade-up textile articles of any textile fabric which are not more specifically described elsewhere in the Nomenclature are classified under Sub-Chapter I of Chapter 63 (see also the HSEN to Chapter 63, General, (1), first paragraph).\n\nThe article is therefore to be classified under CN code 6307 90 98 as other made-up textile articles.",

When the article is fully assembled, the base is fixed to the cylindrical plastic covering of the article by a detachable round clasp.\n\nInside, there is a splice tray made of plastics, attached to the base of the article. This tray contains specific grooves to align optical fibres\/optical cables and it is equipped with connectors.\n\nThe article as a whole is intended for the preservation of optical fibres\/optical cables and may be used in different kinds of networks.\n\n### Classification (Combined Nomenclature (CN) code)\n\n8536 70 00\n\n## Reason\n\nClassification is determined by general rules 1 and 6 for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature, Note 7 to Chapter 85 and by the wording of CN codes 8536 and 8536 70 00.\n\nClassification under CN code 8536 90 10 is excluded since that code covers ‘connections and contact elements for wire and cables’, such as, electrical apparatus for making electrical connections. The article in question is a box with connectors for optical fibres, optical fibre bundles or optical cables and does not possess any electrical connections.\n\nThe article has the characteristics of connectors for optical fibres, opticle fibre bundles or optical cables which simply mechanically align optical fibres end to end in a digital line system (see also the Harmonized System Explanatory Notes to heading 8536, part IV).\n\nGiven its characteristics, the article is therefore to be classified under CN code 8536 70 00 as connectors for optical fibres, optical fibre bundles or cables.",

The distribution volume can be adjusted by the grip. It’s suitable for regular maintenance of large areas.\n\n### Classification (Combined Nomenclature (CN) code)\n\nCode 8424 89 70.\n\n### Reasons\n\nClassification is determined by general rules 1, 3(c) and 6 for the interpretation of the CN, Note 2 to Chapter 84, and by the wording of CN codes 8424, 8424 89 and 8424 89 70.\n\nThe appliance answers to the description under heading 8424 (dispersing of sand and salt) and to the description under heading 8432 (fertiliser distributor and a seeder). It cannot be classified by virtue of Note 3 to Section XVI as it does not perform one principal function. In accordance with Note 2 to Chapter 84, an appliance which answers to a description in one or more of the headings 8401 to 8424 and at the same time to a description in one or other of the headings 8425 to 8480 is to be classified under the appropriate heading of the former group (heading 8424 in this case).\n\nThe appliance can be used both as an agricultural or horticultural appliance of subheading 8424 82 and as other appliances of subheading 8424 89. Given its characteristics, neither of those functions is considered to be the principal function of the appliance within the meaning of Note 3 to Section XVI and neither of the two subheadings is considered to provide a more specific description. Consequently, the appliance is to be classified under the subheading that occurs last in numerical order.\n\nThe appliance is therefore to be classified under CN code 8424 89 70 as other mechanical appliances for projecting, dispersing or spraying liquids or powders.",

		"story" : "## Provisional safeguard measures imposed on imports of certain steel products\n\nThe European Commission has imposed provisional safeguard measures on certain steel products by Implementing Regulation [2018\/1013](https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/legal-content\/EN\/TXT\/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2018.181.01.0039.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2018:181:TOC) Official Journal ref L181.\n\nAffected products, en route to the EU before 19 July 2018, whose destination cannot be changed, will not be subject to the quotas or additional duty, provided proof of contract and other supporting documents are presented to customs, and may be entered to free circulation. If these documents are not immediately available it is recommended that the quotas are claimed as a precaution.\n\nProducts listed, and grouped by product number, in Annex I will be subject to Tariff quotas for a period of 200 days from 19 July 2018 or until the quota exhausts, if earlier.\n\nThe quota order numbers (to be claimed in box 39 of the SAD) and volumes which can be imported before incurring safeguard duties are listed in Annex V.\n\nWhen the quota is exhausted or where product categories do not benefit from the quota, additional duty of 25% will apply to the customs value of the imported product.\n\nIf any provisional safeguard duty is incurred it must be paid at the time of clearance (that is, not by lodging a security).\n\nThe declarant is responsible for claiming the quota. If a claim is not made on the SAD document when there is still an available balance, the additional duty of 25% will be charged.\n\nThe origin of the product is determined by non-preferential origin rules.\n\nUnless otherwise specified, customs duties in force will also apply, this includes any anti-dumping and countervailing duties.\n\nThe import duty for these goods is usually zero, often due to preferential arrangements existing for some countries. These arrangements do not eliminate the liability to the safeguard duty. Only a successful quota claim will exempt the liability to the 25% additional duty. Therefore, to enable the correct calculation of duty, preference should not be claimed.\n\nThe quotas will be administered on a first come first served basis, as per Articles 49-54 of regulation [2015\/2447](https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/legal-content\/EN\/TXT\/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2015.343.01.0558.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2015:343:TOC).\n\nProducts within the groups which originate in the countries marked with an X in Annex IV or originate in any other non-EU country (except Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein) will be subject to these quotas, later followed by additional duties.\n\nProducts within the groups which originate in the countries listed in Annex IV, but not marked with an X are exempt from these measures.\n\nWhere anti-dumping and countervailing duties also apply the Commission will ensure that the combined effect of these measures do not exceed the highest level of the safeguard or anti-dumping\/countervailing duties in place.\n\nUSA imports are also subject to separate additional duties imposed by Regulation 2018\/886 on 22 June 2018.\n\nInterested parties may make comment on the findings of the investigation to the Commission, for its consideration when reaching its final conclusion.\n\nQuota balances can be viewed on the following [quota database](http:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/taxation_customs\/dds2\/taric\/quota_consultation.jsp?Lang=en).\n\nIf in doubt about the measures that apply please enter the commodity code and country of origin into the Commission’s [Taric database](http:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/taxation_customs\/dds2\/taric\/taric_consultation.jsp?Lang=en&Screen=0&redirectionDate=20100625).\n\nTo apply these measures the following changes have been made to CHIEF.\n\nThe tariff quotas referred to in Annex V have been inserted, for further details see regulation [2018\/1013](https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/legal-content\/EN\/TXT\/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2018.181.01.0039.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2018:181:TOC). To claim a quota enter code 120 in box 36 and enter the relevant quota number in box 39 of the SAD declaration.\n\nTo enable CHIEF to calculate the safeguard correctly when tariff quotas are not claimed or are exhausted the full duty on the affected commodities has been changed to 25%.\n\nA full duty suspension measure (FB) has been inserted against all the affected commodities. This must only be used for imports from Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein or for imports of the goods listed in the product groups from countries not marked with an X in Annex IV. Details on how this must be declared in Box 47c of your declaration can be found in [UK Trade Tariff: imports and community transport inwards](https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/publications\/uk-trade-tariff-imports-and-community-transport-inwards\/uk-trade-tariff-imports-and-community-transport-inwards).\n\nAffected products that were en route to the EU before 19 July 2018 and whose destination cannot be changed may use the DTY override function, provided proof of contract and other supporting documents are presented to customs. If these documents are not immediately available, as previously stated, it is recommended that the quotas are claimed as a precaution.\n\nWhen the remaining quota balance falls below 10% a security to the value of the potential duty must be lodged before customs clearance. This may be reclaimed in full or part depending on the percentage of the quota allocated to the claim.\n\nCHIEF was updated on 31 July 2018. Post clearance action will be required for affected products clearing customs between 19 July 2018 and 31 July 2018.\n\nMore information is available in [tariff quota notice 104](https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/publications\/tariff-quota-notice-104-2018-the-opening-of-new-quotas-imposing-provisional-safeguard-measures-on-imports-of-certain-steel-products).\n\n### Important\n\nIn any case where the information contained in this notice is at variance with that published in the official journal of the European Union the latter will reflect the correct legal position.The HMRC tarrif, volume 1, section 1 refers\n\nTarrif and Quota Management Team  \nSouthend on Sea  \n\nAny operational queries please email [chief.operations@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:chief.operations@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk).\n\nGeneral queries should be emailed to [tariff.management@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:tariff.management@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk).",

Thereby the sugar content is reduced from approximately 60% to 2% and the betaine content is increased from 5% to 40%. The product is used solely as an animal feed premix facilitating digestion and maintaining intestinal stability. The product is packed in 1,000kg containers or imported in bulk.\n\n## Classification\n\nThe Combined Nomenclature (CN) code for these goods is 2309 90 96.\n\n## Reason\n\nClassification is determined by general rules 1 and 6 for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature (CN) and the wording of CN codes 2309, 2309 90 and 2309 90 96.\n\nThe product cannot be classified under heading 1703 as molasses because it does not contain an appreciable amount of sugar (see also the Harmonized System Explanatory Notes (HSEN) to heading 1703, first paragraph, penultimate sentence).\n\nThe product cannot be classified under heading 2303 as other waste of sugar manufacture due to its deliberate production from molasses in conjunction with its intended use as a feed premix (see also the HSEN to heading 2303, letter (D)). A feed premix which improves digestion in animals is a preparation of a kind used in animal feeding of heading 2309 (see also the HSEN to heading 2309, part (II) (C), point (1)).\n\nThe product is therefore to be classified under CN code 2309 90 96 as a preparation of a kind used in animal feeding.",

Each cable consists of 32 insulated single conductors for a voltage not exceeding 1 000 V, bundled into 16 sheathed pairs which are not twisted. These pairs are covered by a metal foil and metal threads.
