1. For the purposes of interpreting the product specific rules of origin set out in this Annex, the following definitions apply:

  a. “section" means a section of the Harmonized System 2012 (HS 2012);  	

  b. “chapter” means a chapter of the Harmonized System 2012 (HS 2012);

  c. “heading” means the first four digits of the tariff classification number under the Harmonized System 2012 (HS 2012);
and

  d. “sub-heading” means the first six digits of the tariff classification number under the Harmonized System 2012 (HS 2012).


2. Under this Annex, a good is an originating good if it is produced entirely in the territory of one or more of the Parties by one or more producers using non-originating materials, and:

  a. each of the non-originating materials used in the production of the good satisfies any applicable change in tariff classification requirement, or the good otherwise satisfies the production process requirement, regional value content requirement, or any other requirement specified in this Annex; and

  b. the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of this Origin Reference Document

3. For the purposes of interpreting the product-specific rules of origin set out in this Annex:

  a. the specific rule, or specific set of rules, that applies to a particular heading, subheading or group of headings or subheadings is set out immediately adjacent to the heading, subheading or group of headings or subheadings;

  b. section, chapter or heading notes, where applicable, are found at the beginning of each section or chapter, and are read in conjunction with the product-specific rules of origin and may impose further conditions on, or provide an alternative to the product-specific rules of origin;

  c. the requirement of a change in tariff classification shall apply only to non-originating materials;

  d. if a product-specific rule of origin excludes certain materials of the Harmonized System, it shall be construed to mean that the product specific rule of origin requires that the excluded materials be originating for the good to be originating;

  e. if a good is subject to alternative product-specific rules of origin, the good shall be originating if it satisfies one of the alternatives;

  f. if a good is subject to a product-specific rule of origin that includes multiple requirements, the good shall be originating only if it satisfies all of the requirements; and

  g. if a single product-specific rule of origin applies to a group of headings or subheadings and that rule of origin specifies a change of heading or subheading, it shall be understood that the change in heading or subheading may occur from any other heading or subheading, as the case may be, including from any other heading or subheading within the group.

4. For goods of chapters 84 and 87 marked with a symbol ( † ), an optional methodology for satisfying the regional value content requirement of the product specific rule of origin shall apply. This methodology is contained in Annex III (Provisions Related to the Product-Specific Rules of Origin for Certain Vehicles and Parts of Vehicles).
