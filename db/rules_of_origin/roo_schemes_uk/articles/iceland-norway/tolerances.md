   - 15% of the net weight of the product falling within Chapters 2 and 4 to 24, other than processed fishery products in Chapter 16;

   - 15% of the ex-works price of the product for products other than those covered by point (a).

2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply to products falling within Chapters 50 to 63, for which the tolerances mentioned in Notes 6 and 7 of Appendix 1 to this Annex shall apply.

3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not allow any of the percentages for the maximum content of non-originating materials, as specified in the rules laid down in the list in Appendix 2 to this Annex, to be exceeded.
