## Article 12 - Importation Requirements

Each Party shall grant preferential tariff treatment in accordance with this Agreement to originating products of a Party imported from a Party, on the basis of a claim for preferential tariff treatment made by the importer based on an origin declaration referred to in Article 19 (Origin Declaration).

An origin declaration must be submitted to the customs authority of the importing Party within one year from its completion or within the validity period provided by the importing Party if longer. The expiration of this period may be suspended as long as the products covered by that origin declaration remain under the customs control of the importing Party. After this period, an origin declaration may be accepted only in exceptional circumstances.

Notwithstanding paragraph 1, a Party may, in accordance with its domestic law, waive the requirements to present an origin declaration.

An importer who has been granted preferential tariff treatment must keep the origin declaration and other relevant documents for three years after the date on which preferential tariff treatment was granted, or longer if required by the law of the importing Party.

## Article 22 - Delayed Claims for Preferential Treatment

If a product would have qualified for preferential treatment when it was imported into a Party but the importer did not have an origin declaration at the time of importation, the importer of the product having a valid origin declaration may, within a period of time of no less than 2 years after the date of importation, apply in accordance with domestic law for a refund of duties paid as a result of the good not having been accorded preferential tariff treatment.

## Article 23 - Importation by Instalments

Where, at the request of an importer and in accordance with domestic laws, regulations, or published requirements of the importing Party, a dismantled or non-assembled product within the meaning of General Rule 2(a) for the interpretation of the Harmonized System is imported by instalments, a single origin declaration may be submitted to the customs authority upon importation of the first instalment. Alternatively, an origin declaration may be submitted for each imported instalment.

## Article 24 - Exemptions from Origin Declaration Requirements

Each Party may, in conformity with its law, waive the requirement to present an origin declaration for low value importations of originating goods from the other Party.

Each Party may exclude any importation from the provisions made under paragraph 1 when the importation is part of a series of importations that may reasonably be considered to have been undertaken or arranged for the purpose of avoiding the requirements of this Annex related to origin declarations.

Each Party may set value limits for products referred to in paragraph 1 and shall exchange information with the other Parties regarding those limits.

## Article 25 - Record Keeping Requirements

The exporting Party shall require an exporter that has completed an origin declaration to keep, and to provide on request:

1. a copy of the origin declaration and all supporting documents; and

2. written statements from producers or suppliers which evidence the origin declaration’s claim that the good is originating,

for three years after the completion of the origin declaration, or for such longer period of time as the exporting Party may specify.

Each Party shall provide that, if an exporter has based an origin declaration on a written statement from a producer or supplier, that producer or supplier shall be required to maintain records in accordance with paragraph 1.

The importing Party may require that an importer that has been granted preferential treatment shall keep documentation relating to the importation of the good, including a copy of the origin declaration, for three years after the date of import, or for such longer period of time as that Party may specify.

Each Party shall permit, in accordance with that Party’s law, importers, exporters, producers and suppliers in that Party to maintain documentation or records in any medium, provided that the documentation or records can be retrieved and printed.

A Party may deny preferential treatment to a good that is the subject of a verification of origin when the importer, exporter, producer or supplier of the good that is required to maintain records or documentation under this Article:

1. fails to maintain records or documentation in accordance with this Annex; or

2. denies access to those records or documentation.

## Article 26 - Cooperation of Exporters and Importers with the Customs Authority

Each Party shall ensure that exporters and importers benefitting from the Agreement must, within the framework of this Agreement and subject to the law of that Party, cooperate with the customs authority of that Party and submit, upon their request, supporting documents regarding the fulfilment of the requirements of this Annex.

The exporting Party shall ensure that an exporter who has completed an origin declaration must:

1. upon request of the customs authority of that Party, submit the documents referred to in paragraph 9 of Article 19 (Origin Declaration) to that authority, which may carry out inspections and verify the exporters’ or the producer’s accounts and take other appropriate measures; and

2. when becoming aware of or having reason to believe that an origin declaration contains incorrect information, immediately notify the importer and the customs authority of the exporting Party of any change affecting the originating status of each product covered by that origin declaration.

The importing Party shall ensure that an importer who has requested or has been granted preferential tariff treatment must:

1. upon request of the customs authority of that Party, submit the documents referred to in paragraph 4 of Article 17 (Non-alteration) to that authority; and

2. when becoming aware of or having reason to believe that the origin declaration contains incorrect information, immediately notify the customs authority of that Party of any change affecting the originating status of each product covered by an origin declaration.

## Article 27 - Discrepancies

The customs authority of the importing Party shall not reject a claim for preferential tariff treatment due to minor errors or discrepancies in the origin declaration, or for the sole reason that an invoice was issued in a third country.

## Article 28 - Verification of Origin

The customs authority of the exporting Party shall carry out verifications of origin declarations on request of the importing Party.

The verification request may question the authenticity of origin declarations, the originating status of the product concerned or the fulfilment of other requirements of this Annex. It shall identify the reasons for the inquiry and include a copy of the origin declaration and, if appropriate, any other document or information giving reason to believe that the origin declaration could be invalid.

The importing Party shall submit the verification request to the exporting Party within 34 months from the completion of the origin declaration. The exporting Party is not obliged to conduct verifications based on verification requests received after that deadline.

The customs authority of the importing Party may, subject to its domestic law, suspend preferential tariff treatment of a product covered by an origin declaration until the verification procedure has been finalised.

The customs authority of the exporting Party may request evidence, carry out inspections at the exporter’s or producer’s premises, check the exporter’s and the producer’s accounts and take other appropriate measures to verify compliance with this Annex.

The requesting Party shall be informed of the results and findings of the verification within 10 months from the date of the verification request. If the requesting Party receives no reply within that time limit, or if the reply does not clearly state whether a product is originating or whether the origin declaration is valid, the requesting Party may deny preferential tariff treatment to the consignment covered by the origin declaration in question.

Where the requested Party is unable to meet the deadline referred to in paragraph 6, it shall, upon request within that deadline, be granted an extension of the deadline.

Each Party shall provide that, if there are differences in relation to the verification procedures of this Article or in the interpretation of the rules of origin in determining whether a good qualifies as originating, and these differences cannot be resolved through consultations between the customs authority requesting the verification and the customs authority responsible for performing the verification, and if the customs authority of the importing Party intends to make a determination of origin that is inconsistent with the results and findings of the verification provided by the customs authority of the exporting Party, the customs authority of the importing Party shall notify the customs authority of the exporting Party within 60 days of receiving those results and findings of the verification.

At the request of either Party, the Parties shall hold and conclude consultations within 90 days from the date of the notification referred to in paragraph 8 to resolve those differences. The period for concluding consultations may be extended on a case-by-case basis by mutual written consent between the Parties. If the differences cannot be settled by consultation between the Parties, each Party may seek to resolve these differences within the Joint Committee.

## Article 29 - Denial of Preferential Tariff Treatment

An importing Party may deny preferential tariff treatment or recover unpaid customs duties in accordance with its domestic law where a product does not meet the requirements of this Annex or where the importer or exporter fails to demonstrate compliance with the relevant requirements.

Slight discrepancies between the statements made in the origin declaration and those made in other documents submitted to the customs authority for customs clearance or obvious formal errors, such as typing errors in an origin declaration, shall not as such render the origin declaration invalid.

In all cases, the settlement of differences between the importer and the customs authority of the importing Party shall be under the law of the importing Party.

## Article 30 - Notifications and cooperation The Parties shall provide each other with:

1. the addresses of their customs authorities responsible for verifications referred to in Article 28 (Verification of Origin) and other issues related to the implementation or application of this Annex;

2. information on the use of electronic signatures and identification codes referred to in Article 19 (Origin Declaration), and authorisation numbers referred to in Article 20 (Approved Exporter); and
