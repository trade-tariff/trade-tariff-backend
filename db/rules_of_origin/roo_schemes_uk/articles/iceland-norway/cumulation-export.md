Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 2 (General Requirements), products shall be considered as originating in the exporting Party when exported to another Party if they are obtained in the exporting Party incorporating materials originating in any Party or in any of the countries listed in Appendix 3 to this Annex provided that the conditions set out in paragraph 6 below are met. It shall not be necessary for such materials to have undergone sufficient working or processing.

Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 2 (General Requirements), working or processing carried out in the United Kingdom, Iceland, Norway or the European Union, shall be considered as having been carried out in the exporting Party, subject to the conditions set out in subparagraphs 6(a) and 6(c).

For cumulation provided for in paragraph 1, where the working or processing carried out in the exporting Party does not go beyond the operations referred to in Article 7 (Insufficient Working or Processing), the product obtained shall be considered as originating in a Party only where the value added there is greater than the value of the materials used originating in each one of the countries referred to in paragraph 1. If this is not so, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in the country which accounts for the highest value of originating materials used in the manufacture in a Party.

For cumulation provided for in paragraph 2, when the working or processing carried out in the exporting Party does not go beyond the operations referred to in Article 7 (Insufficient Working or Processing), the product obtained shall be considered as originating in the exporting Party only when the value added there is greater than the value added in each one of the other countries listed in paragraph 2.

Products originating in one of the other countries referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 which do not undergo any working or processing in the exporting Party shall retain their origin if exported into one of these countries.

The conditions set out in this paragraph are:

1. preferential trade agreements in accordance with Article XXIV of GATT 1994 are in effect between the exporting Party and the non-Party in question and between the importing Party and that non-Party, which foresee procedures for proving origin and administrative cooperation procedures, including procedures for verification of originating status;

2. for cumulation of materials, these materials meet the relevant rules under this Agreement (mutatis mutandis) in order to qualify as originating in the non-Party in question; and

3. the working or processing carried out in the exporting Party goes beyond those referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 7 (Insufficient Working or Processing), without prejudice to paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article. Such materials do not have to undergo sufficient working or processing.

Where preferential trade agreements are in effect between the exporting Party and a non-Party not listed in Appendix 3 to this Annex and between the importing Party and the same non-Party, the following shall apply:

1. Products imported from that non-Party which are used as materials in the manufacture of a product in a Party, which product is subsequently exported to the other Party, shall be considered as originating in the Party where the last operation has been carried out once a decision to that effect has been adopted by the Joint Committee, and subject to the terms of that decision;

2. Except to the extent that that decision may provide to the contrary, the terms of that decision, once it is adopted, shall be deemed to include the conditions set out in paragraph 6;

3. The Joint Committee shall take into account the special position of materials classified within Chapters 1 to 24 and Chapters 35 and 38 of the Harmonized System, insofar as sensitive sectors may be affected; and

4. The Parties shall use their best endeavours to ensure that the Joint Committee shall reach an appropriate decision promptly on the request of any Party and, if that decision lays down further conditions, that such conditions shall be the least trade-restrictive conditions reasonable in the circumstances.
