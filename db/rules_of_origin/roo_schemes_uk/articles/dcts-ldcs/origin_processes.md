## Claims for preferential tariff treatment
Unless otherwise specified, a claim for preferential tariff treatment must be made on the basis of a proof of origin made out by the exporter and must take the form of:

$LegislativeList
  * &nbsp; &bull; &nbsp; Form A made out in accordance with Annex A;
  * &nbsp; &bull; &nbsp; an origin declaration provided on an invoice or any other commercial document that describes the goods concerned in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified and contains:
    * &#9900; &nbsp; the statement set out in Annex B; and
    * &#9900; &nbsp; the data elements identified in that Annex; or 
    * &#9900; &nbsp; a proof of origin made out in accordance with the former UK Generalised Scheme of Preferences that is issued on or before 31 December 2023.
$EndLegislativeList

A claim for preferential tariff treatment must be included in the customs import declaration.

The proof of origin must be made out by the exporter within two years prior to the date of the importation. Proofs of origin made out more than two years prior to the date of importation may be accepted where the failure to submit them is due to exceptional circumstances.

For the purpose of this notice, “the date of importation” is the date of acceptance by HMRC of the declaration for free circulation or authorised use into the United Kingdom relating to the relevant goods.

If a claim for preferential tariff treatment was not made on the date of importation, HMRC will grant preferential tariff treatment and repay or remit any excess customs duty paid provided that:

$LegislativeList
  * &nbsp; &bull; &nbsp; the claim for preferential tariff treatment is made no later than two years after the date of importation;  
  * &nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;the proof of origin is made out by the exporter within two years prior to the date of the claim; and
  * &nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;	the goods would have been regarded as originating from the beneficiary country under the Origin Regulations and would have satisfied all the requirements of this notice had the claim been made at the time of importation.
$EndLegislativeList

## Conditions for making out a proof of origin

A proof of origin must be made out by the exporter operating in a beneficiary country and that exporter should:

$LegislativeList
  * &nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;	maintain appropriate commercial accounting records concerning the production and supply of goods qualifying for preferential tariff treatment; and
  * &nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;	be prepared to provide at any time, at the request of the customs or other competent governmental authority of the exporting country, all supporting documents or written statements from producers and suppliers which evidence a claim that the goods are originating.

  * &nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;	the originating status of, the purchase of, the cost of, the value of, and the payment for all materials, including, where relevant, indirect material used in the production of the good and which have been relied on by the exporter in determining the regional value content of the good;
  * &nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;	where cumulation under regulation 17, 18, 19, 20 or 21 respectively of the Origin Regulations is applied:

    * a.	in the case of bilateral cumulation with the UK, (this includes Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man), the proof of origin provided by the UK exporter made out in accordance with this notice;

A proof of origin:

$LegislativeList
  * &nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;	must be made out in English and, if handwritten, completed in ink;
  * &nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;	must bear the signature of the exporter; and
  * &nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;	may be sent electronically from the exporter to the importer.
$EndLegislativeList

An exporter may make out a proof of origin after exportation of the goods to which it relates if:

$LegislativeList
  * &nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;	it was not issued at the time of exportation because of errors or involuntary omissions or special circumstances;
  * &nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;	it was issued but was not accepted at importation for technical reasons; or
  * &nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;	the final destination of the goods concerned was determined during their transportation or storage and after splitting of a consignment, in accordance with the Origin Regulations.
$EndLegislativeList

## Application of a proof of origin

A proof of origin may apply to:

$LegislativeList
  * &nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;	a single shipment of originating goods; or
  * &nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;	multiple shipments of identical goods which:
    * &#9900; &nbsp;	are imported within the framework of frequent and continuous trade flows of a significant commercial value not exceeding 12 months;
    * &#9900; &nbsp;	are the subject of the same contract of sale;
    * &#9900; &nbsp;	are classified in the same code (eight digits) of the Combined Nomenclature; and
    * &#9900; &nbsp;	come exclusively from the same exporter, are destined for the same importer, and are made the subject of entry formalities at the same customs office in the UK.
$EndLegislativeList

On request of the importer, where unassembled or disassembled products falling within Section XVI or XVII or heading 7308 or 9406 of the Harmonised System are imported in instalments for transport or production reasons, a single proof of origin for such products may be used in accordance with any additional requirements laid down by HMRC.


## Exemptions from proof of origin requirements

Personal goods and those imported by way of trade shall be exempted from the obligation to make out and produce a proof of origin provided the following conditions are met:

$LegislativeList
 * &nbsp; &bull; &nbsp; the total value of the goods referred to above does not exceed £1,000;
 * &nbsp; &bull; &nbsp; the claim for preferential tariff treatment is included in the customs import declaration; and
 * &nbsp; &bull; &nbsp; HMRC do not doubt the veracity of the claim for preferential tariff treatment. 
$EndLegislativeList

## Discrepancies and errors
 
Slight discrepancies discovered between the statements made in a proof of origin and those made in the documents submitted to the customs office for the purpose of carrying out the formalities for importing the goods shall not in themselves render the proof of origin null and void if it is duly established that it corresponds to the goods submitted.

Obvious errors on a proof of origin shall not cause it to be rejected if these errors do not create doubts concerning the originating status of the goods.

|Box|Detail|
|-|-|
|Box&nbsp;1|Enter the full name and business address of the exporter.|
|Box&nbsp;2|**Consignee**<br>The completion of this box is optional, but you are recommended to enter the name and address of the consignee where this is known. For exports to exhibitions which are later sent on to the UK, also insert the name and address of the exhibition.|
|Box&nbsp;3|**Transport details**<br>You should complete this box on the basis of available information. If you do not have details of the transport arrangements, then leave this box blank.|
|Box&nbsp;4|**For official use**<br>This box is reserved for the use of the certifying authority. However, if the Form A has been made out after the goods have been shipped, stamp or write “Issued Retrospectively”.|
|Box&nbsp;5|**Item number**<br>If different types of goods are shown separately on the invoice(s), show each type separately on the Form A and itemise them (1, 2, 3 etc), so they can be cross-checked to the invoice if necessary.|
|Box&nbsp;6|**Marks and numbers**<br>Enter the identifying marks and numbers that appear on the packages. If the packages are marked with the address of the consignee, state the address. If they are not marked in any way, put “No marks and numbers”. If both originating and non-originating goods are packed together, add “Part contents only” at the end of each entry.
|Box&nbsp;7|**Number and kind of packages, description of goods**<br><br>**Bulk Goods**<br>Identify the goods by giving a reasonably full commercial description e.g. 'photocopiers' or 'typewriters' rather than 'office machinery'. However, if the invoices give full identifying details (which need not necessarily include details of the marks and numbers of the packages) only a general description is needed. For goods in bulk which are not individually packed, insert “In bulk”. The quantity shown must be the same as, or relatable to, the quantity shown on the invoice for the goods (e.g. if the invoice shows 100 cartons and these are loaded on to 10 pallets, specify “100 cartons” NOT “10 pallets”).<br><br>**Mixed consignments**<br>For consignments containing both originating and non-originating goods, describe only the originating goods on the Form A. You may be unable to avoid showing originating and non- originating goods on the same invoice. In this case, mark the invoice (for example, with an asterisk) to show which goods are non-originating and put an appropriate statement in Box 7 immediately below the description of the goods (e.g. “Goods marked * on the invoice are non-originating and are not covered by this Form A”). The same considerations will apply if you have a mixed consignment of goods qualifying by virtue of a derogation and others which are not covered by that derogation.<br><br>**Unused space**<br>Draw a horizontal line under the final item in this box and rule through the unused space with a Z-shaped line.|
|Box&nbsp;8|**Origin criterion**<br>This box signifies to HMRC which origin rule has been applied to the goods.<br><br>As described in the note about it on the reverse of the Form A, enter the code:<br><br>&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp; “P” for wholly obtained goods; or<br><br>&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp; “W”, followed by the heading, where the goods have been sufficiently processed.<br><br>For example:  for wholly obtained goods of, say, heading 96.18, the indication should read: "P" and for sufficiently processed goods of the same heading, it should read: "W” 96.18.<br><br>Failure to complete this box correctly could lead to the rejection of the Form A.|
|Box&nbsp;9|**Gross weight or other quantity**<br>Insert the quantity in metric units (e.g. kilograms, litres etc).|
|Box&nbsp;10|**Number and date of invoice**<br>You are recommended to enter the details of the commercial invoice as this ensures the signatory has verified the ex-works price.|
|Box&nbsp;11|**Certification**<br>This field may be left blank. The UK no longer requires the Form A to be certified by a designated authority in the exporting DCTS country.
|Box&nbsp;12|**Declaration by the exporter**<br>Complete this box by inserting the name of the country in which the goods are considered to have originated. You should take into account that where the provisions for regional cumulation have been applied, that country may not be the same as the country of final processing or the country of exportation. For the importing country you must put “United Kingdom”; indicating a different importing country (e.g. European Union) will lead to the Form A not being accepted.<br><br>Only the exporter, or a person duly authorised by the exporter, can sign this declaration. Forwarding agents acting simply in that capacity are not exporters and must not sign this box.<br><br>By signing this form, you declare that the goods qualify under the provisions of the Trade Preference Scheme (Developing Countries Trading Scheme) Regulations 2023 and the Customs (Origin of Chargeable Goods: Developing Countries Trading Scheme) Regulations 2023. If the declaration is incorrect, you will have committed an offence which may incur penalties.|
