The origin declaration is provided on an invoice or any other commercial document that describes the originating product in sufficient detail to enable its identification.

The text of the origin declaration is set out in Annex 2 of the [Origin Reference Document]({ord_url}).

In the UK, the exporterâ€™s reference number will be the EORI number. If you do not have one, you can [apply for an EORI number](https://www.gov.uk/eori).
