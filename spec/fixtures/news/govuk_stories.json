It is approximately 65 cm wide, 125 cm long and 129 cm high (measured at the seat back, 85 cm with the seat back folded down). Its total weight is approximately 107 kg (108 kg including the batteries). The maximum load is approximately 130 kg.\n\nThe vehicle has the following characteristics:\n\n*   a horizontal platform connecting the front and rear sections; the platform cannot be adjusted in any way (e.g. folded or tilted) to suit the user’s needs\n*   two sprung axles, rear-axle drive and an 820mm wheelbase\n*   gradient capability 130\n*   turning circle 210 cm\n*   two sets of inflatable tyres (the rear tyres being larger than the front ones)\n*   a configurable, height-adjustable rotating seat with supports and armrests and a non-slip surface for the feet\n*   an adjustable fold-down steering column with oval-shaped handlebars\n*   front and rear lights, direction indicators and rear-view mirrors\n\nThe steering column also has a dashboard featuring a switch box, a speed control, a horn button, an engine-idle button, a blinker switch, a light switch, a battery-status indicator and a speed adjuster.\n\nThe vehicle has two manually operated levers for accelerating, braking and reversing. The steering can be adjusted to allow operation with one hand.\n\nIt has a ‘smart’ regenerative electromagnetic braking system.\n\nWith fully charged batteries, the vehicle has a maximum range of up to 45 kilometres and can reach a maximum speed of approximately 15-16 km\/h.\n\nIt may be fitted with small anti-tipping wheels at the back, a shopping basket, a walking-stick holder, etc.\n\nThe vehicle may be stowed for transport purposes. It may be used on roads, pavements, footpaths, pathways in parks, cycle paths and certain leisure trails, or in pedestrian areas (e.g. shopping precincts).\n\n### Classification (Combined Nomenclature (CN) code)\n\n8703 10 18\n\n## Reason\n\nClassification is determined by General Rules 1 and 6 for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature and by the wording of CN codes 8703 , 8703 10 and 8703 10 18.\n\nClassification under heading 8713 as a carriage for disabled persons is excluded as the vehicle is not specially designed for the transport of disabled persons: it has no special features to alleviate a disability.\n\nAlthough the vehicle is designed so that the steering can be controlled with one hand and features a comfortable rotating seat with supports and a non-slip surface for the feet (and may optionally be fitted with small anti-tipping wheels), such characteristics do not objectively constitute special features designed to alleviate a disability (see also the Combined Nomenclature Explanatory Notes (CNEN) to subheading 8713 90 00 , the Harmonized System Explanatory Notes to heading 8713 and HS classification opinion 8703.10\/1).\n\nIn addition, vehicles fitted with a separate, adjustable steering column and those reaching a maximum speed over 10 km per hour are excluded from heading 8713 (see also CNEN to subheading 8713 90 00 ).\n\nThe vehicle is used for transporting persons and upon presentation to customs authorities it is not recognisable as a vehicle designed solely for disabled persons (see Case C-198\/15 (1)), based on its objective characteristics and properties which must be assessed at the time of customs clearance (see Case C-286\/15 (2)). Any subsequent post-clearance modification of the vehicle is disregarded as is any assessment of the vehicle that may be carried out by a national authority for purposes other than those laid down in customs legislation.\n\nThe vehicle is a special type of vehicle for the transport of persons.\n\nIt is therefore to be classified under CN code 8703 10 18 as a motor vehicle principally designed for the transport of persons, similar to golf cars.",

The brush is designed to be used to apply the liquid.\n\nThe product is a conditioner for eyelashes and is intended to be used to moisturise and nourish them. It helps protecting them from brittleness and breakage and extending the growth phase of the eyelashes and therefore their lifespan.\n\nThe product contains the following main ingredients:\n\n*   biotin\n*   dechloro dihydroxy difluoro ethylcloprostenolamide\n*   biotinoyl tripeptide-1\n*   calendula extract\n*   ginseng extract\n\nThe product is presented in a cardboard box, put up for retail sale.\n\n### Classification (Combined Nomenclature (CN) code)\n\n3304 99 00\n\n## Reason\n\nClassification is determined by general rules 1 and 6 for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature and the wording of CN codes 3304 and 3304 99 00.\n\nClassification under heading 3305 is excluded as the product is a preparation applied to hair on parts of the human body other than the scalp (see also the Harmonized System Explanatory Note (HSEN) to heading 3305, exclusion note).\n\nAs the product helps improving flexibility, moisture, and shine, it is considered as a beauty preparation (see also the HSEN to heading 3304, (A)(3)). Therefore, classification under heading 3307 as ‘other perfumery, cosmetic or toilet preparations, not elsewhere specified or included’ is excluded.\n\nConsequently, the product is to be classified in CN code 3304 99 00 as a beauty preparation.",

The articles of varying lengths and diameters can be solid or they can be perforated and have cooling channels, with blunt ends. Some of the articles may also have been chamfered.\n\nThe articles are made of cermet, namely of sintered metal carbide on the basis of tungsten carbide with cobalt as the binding substance. Based on their low degree of processing, simple form and shape, the articles can be used for a wide range of uses, for example, as reinforcement elements. If further processed, the articles may be used for tools and as tools.\n\n8113 00 90\n\n## Reason\n\nClassification is determined by general rules 1 and 6 for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature, note 4 to Section XV and by the wording of the CN codes 8113 00 and 8113 00 90 .\n\nClassification under CN code 8209 00 80 as sticks and the like for tools, unmounted, of cermets is excluded as the articles can be used for tools and as tools only if further processed and are also suitable for other uses.\n\nThe articles fall within the scope of heading 8113 , which covers cermets, whether unwrought or in the form of articles not elsewhere specified in the Combined Nomenclature (see also Harmonized System Explanatory Notes to heading 8113 , sixth paragraph).\n\nConsequently, the articles are to be classified under CN code 8113 00 90 as cermets and other articles thereof.",
