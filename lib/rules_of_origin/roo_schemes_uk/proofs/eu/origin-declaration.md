In the EU, the exporter’s reference number will be the exporter’s registered exporter (REX) number. A statement on origin can be provided by any exporter for consignments with a total value of less than £5,400 / 6,000 euros. For consignments with a total value of more than £5,400 / 6,000 euros, the exporter must hold a valid REX registration and include their REX number on the statement on origin.

In the UK, the exporter’s reference number will be the EORI number. If you do not have one, you can [apply for an EORI number](https://www.gov.uk/eori).

Statements on origin are also known as origin declarations. Find out more about using [origin declarations](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-proof-of-origin-for-your-goods#origin-declaration).
